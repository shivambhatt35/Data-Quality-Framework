# Data Quality Engine

A **modular**, **high-performance** data quality engine built with **PySpark** — enabling rule-based validations, seamless integration, and automated reporting for enterprise-grade data integrity.

---

## Project Overview

The **Data Quality (DQ) Engine** is a **scalable and configurable framework** designed to ensure the **accuracy, completeness, and reliability** of enterprise data. Leveraging **PySpark's distributed computing capabilities**, the engine efficiently handles **large-scale datasets** while maintaining high performance and throughput.  

Its **modular architecture** allows for **plug-and-play integration** into existing ETL and data pipelines, supporting a broad spectrum of **rule-based validations** that cover critical data quality dimensions. The engine is suitable for both **technical and non-technical users**, thanks to its **intuitive rule templates** and automated reporting capabilities.

## Key Objectives

1. **Data Accuracy:** Ensure values conform to expected types, formats, and reference lists.  
2. **Data Completeness:** Detect and report missing or null values in critical fields.  
3. **Consistency and Integrity:** Validate relationships between fields and enforce business rules.  
4. **Scalability:** Support distributed processing of large datasets with PySpark.  
5. **Automation:** Generate detailed data quality reports to reduce manual intervention.

## Supported Validation Rules

The engine supports a comprehensive set of validations:

1. **Completeness Checks:** Detect missing values in mandatory fields.  
2. **Pattern Matching:** Validate field formats using regex (e.g., email, phone, IDs).  
3. **Reference Data Validation:** Cross-check values against approved lookup/reference tables.  
4. **Data Profiling:** Summarize distributions, detect anomalies, and highlight trends.  
5. **Uniqueness Checks:** Ensure primary keys or unique identifiers have no duplicates.  
6. **Timeliness Validation:** Confirm data arrives within expected time windows.  
7. **Range Checks:** Verify numeric values fall within defined min/max limits.  
8. **Null Checks:** Flag mandatory fields with NULL or missing entries.  
9. **Consistency Checks:** Compare related fields for logical integrity (e.g., `start_date < end_date`).  
10. **Data Type Validation:** Ensure fields match expected data types (integer, string, date, etc.).  
11. **Business Rule Validation:** Apply custom logic (e.g., “If Country = 'US', then ZipCode must be 5 digits”).
