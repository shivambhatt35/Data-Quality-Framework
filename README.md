# 🧠 Data Quality Engine 🔍✨  
A **modular**, **high-performance** data quality engine built with **PySpark** — enabling rule-based validations, seamless integration, and automated reporting for enterprise-grade data integrity.

---

## 📦 Summary  

The **Data Quality (DQ) Engine** is a powerful and scalable framework developed using **PySpark** to ensure the **accuracy**, **completeness**, and **reliability** of data across diverse systems and use cases.  

⚡ Leveraging PySpark’s distributed computing capabilities, the engine efficiently handles **large-scale datasets** while maintaining top performance. Its **modular architecture** allows easy integration into existing data pipelines and ensures long-term **scalability** and **maintainability**.  

🛠️ Designed with both developers and non-technical users in mind, the engine supports a broad spectrum of **rule-based validations**, including:

✅ Completeness Checks – Ensure no missing values in critical fields.
🔤 Pattern Matching – Validate formats (e.g., email, phone, ID) using regex.
🔗 Reference Data Validation – Verify that data matches approved lookup/reference lists.
📊 Data Profiling – Summarize data distributions and detect anomalies.
🔁 Uniqueness Checks – Ensure no duplicate values exist in key columns (e.g., primary keys).
📅 Timeliness Validation – Check if data arrives within expected time windows.
🔢 Range Checks – Ensure numerical values fall within specified min/max limits.
🧪 Null Checks – Flag missing or NULL entries in mandatory fields.
🆚 Consistency Checks – Compare fields for logical consistency (e.g., start_date < end_date).
🔐 Data Type Validation – Ensure values conform to expected data types (e.g., integer, string, date).
🧩 Business Rule Validation – Apply complex logic (e.g., “If Country = 'US', then ZipCode must be 5 digits”).

With a **highly configurable design** and **intuitive rule templates**, the DQ Engine simplifies complex business-specific checks and automates the generation of **detailed data quality reports**, offering **actionable insights** to maintain enterprise-level data health.
